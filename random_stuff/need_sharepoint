EpicWebService, in order to perform some of it's functions properly, requires
sharepoint.  Is there a sharepoint instance we can point to in order to test
EpicWebService?  If not, do we know how to configure an instance of 
sharepoint that we can use as a test instance?  In the latter case, can we
get some "live" data that can be used as test data?  Also, we could use
the exact method of installation on the production servers.

Without the file store, the only way we have to test EpicWebService is to
use the ResponseServer/GetResponse that accesses the database (which we do
have a test instance of).  For any major code changes, this limited
ability to test is somewhat disconcerting.

The CRs we're working on are related to logging.
In the interest of full disclosure, all functions in EpicWebService use
the same logging code/path.  So, in terms of logging and email, things 
appear to work as specified in the CR (310939 and 269943).  However, we
really need the ability to verify that other aspects of the code are not
broken by our changes and the we didn't miss something which is very
difficult given what we know at this moment.
