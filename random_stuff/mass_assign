The mass assignment is not an issue for the following reasons:
  The data uses a DTO which includes only the fields needed for an operation.
  The user data (target) is verified against existing database values.
  The user data (performing action) is validated against database values.
  The user data (performing action) is validated against the users roles to
  assure that the user is allowed to perform that action.
