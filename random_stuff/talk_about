generalized automation for all apps
   introduced app selection
   ability to choose repo path (with default)
reorganized the code so easier to know what is going on
   cleaned up app, introduced functions
created installer files for most apps
determined what a number of the install exceptions might be
   ebsprofile, ebsadmin, easadmin most specifically
test install to make sure the work, at least to my iis pools
Introduced "ASIS" function for each application
   if you choose ASIS, the git repo will be used as the developer has it

STUFF THAT IS TO BE DONE

Add "ALL"  select ALL installs all applications
   This one will have subtasks.  Setting multiple defaults, etc.

QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE
Do we need the ability to run on an OS other than windows?
Resolve now before we're seriously invested in powershell.
There will be additional questions.
   Some will be answerable by discussion with appropriate user.
   Others will need experimentation.
