#   It is here as a crude example of running a route/api test
#   without using swagger or selenium.  Since ASB is, for 
#   all intents and purposes, a service, it is treated as such.
#   That means the URI is sent to ASB in a similar way to what
#   swagger would do.  The pass/fail processing here is very
#   simple and would need to have json result processing added.
#   With that, it would be possible pick out individual json
#   sections (status, result count, text) to further ensure that
#   the test did actually pass.
